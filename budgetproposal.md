### Initial Budget Proposal 2/2/2015

<p>For my project, I decided to do a word clock. Basically, it will tell time in words with letters being in a matrix. So to display the time 12:30 it would say “It is half past twelve”. To accomplish this I will need to create a matrix of LEDs where I can control each LED individually. The easiest way I found to do this is to create the matrix with LED strips instead of single LEDs. If I use LED strips then I will not have to use as many shift registers and overall it will be easier to manage. This is the main cost of my project as I will need around 3 meters of the LED strips.</p>
	
<p>As for the other parts... I will need the capacitor for the LED strip to store energy and supply the amount of current needed.The solderable breadboard is what I will use to solder everything together. The soft potentiometers will be used to control the clock (they are basically flat pressure sensors), I may need to trade these out for buttons, because I am not sure how to fully integrate them into my project yet.</p>
